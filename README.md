# RecipePlanner

RecipePlanner is designed to alleviate the complexity of modded Factorio recipe structures.

## Features

- Console-driven recipe input
- File-driven recipe input
- Raw resource calculation (works as an extension of stock raws which is unrestricted by hand-craftable recipes)
- Machine ratio calculation (outputs "craft-seconds/second" which, when divided by the machine's crafting rate, yields the number of machines)
- Recipe branch selection

## Planned Features

- Algorithmic selection of branches
- Optimization
- Loop support

## Known Issues

- Little to no error catching, much less recovery
- Recipe format has poor human readability
- Interface is _ugly_
